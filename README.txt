To launch the application: 
Step 1) execute the RestaurantAPI.java class on the server's side ("src/server/java/springapplication/RestaurantAPI.java");
Step 2) execute the Starter.java class on the client's side ("src/client/java/javafxapplication/Starter.java");

To check the System Design Document, Requirements Analysis Document or Class Diagram, look for the corresponding files in the Reservation System App directry (the same directory this README is located in).
